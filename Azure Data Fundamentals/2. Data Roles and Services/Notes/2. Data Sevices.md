# Identify data services
**Microsoft Azure** is a cloud platform that powers the applications and IT infrastructure for some of the world's largest organizations. It includes many services to support cloud solutions, including *transactional* and *analytical* data workloads.

Some of the most commonly used cloud services for data are described below.

## Azure SQL

</kbd>

**Azure SQL** is the collective name for a family of *relational database* solutions based on the **Microsoft SQL Server** database engine. Specific Azure SQL services include:
* **Azure SQL Database** – a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) database hosted in Azure
* **Azure SQL Managed Instance** – a hosted instance of SQL Server with automated maintenance, which allows more flexible configuration than Azure SQL DB but with more administrative responsibility for the owner.
* **Azure SQL VM** – a virtual machine with an installation of SQL Server, allowing maximum configurability with full management responsibility.
Database administrators typically provision and manage Azure SQL database systems to support line of business (LOB) applications that need to store transactional data.

**Data engineers** may use Azure SQL database systems as sources for data pipelines that perform *extract*, *transform*, and *load* (ETL) operations to ingest the *transactional* data into an *analytical* system.

**Data analysts** may query Azure SQL databases directly to create *reports*, though in large organizations the data is generally combined with data from other sources in an *analytical* data store to support enterprise analytics.


## Azure Database for open-source relational databases

</kbd>

Azure includes managed services for popular open-source relational database systems, including:
* **Azure Database for MySQL** - a simple-to-use open-source database management system that is commonly used in *Linux*, *Apache*, *MySQL*, and *PHP* (LAMP) stack apps.
* **Azure Database for MariaDB** - a newer database management system, created by the original developers of *MySQL*. The database engine has since been rewritten and optimized to improve performance. *MariaDB* offers compatibility with Oracle Database (another popular commercial database management system).
* **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** - a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a *PostgreSQL* database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties.

As with Azure SQL database systems, open-source relational databases are managed by database administrators to support *transactional applications*, and provide a data source for data engineers building pipelines for analytical solutions and data analysts creating reports.


## Azure Cosmos DB

<kbd>
    <img src="image6" height="auto" width="400" />
</kbd>

**Azure Cosmos DB** is a global-scale *non-relational* (NoSQL) database system that supports multiple application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling you to *store* and *manage* data as **JSON documents**, **key-value** pairs, **column-families**, and **graphs**.

In some organizations, Cosmos DB instances may be provisioned and managed by a *database administrator*; though often *software developers* manage NoSQL data storage as part of the overall application architecture. *Data engineers* often need to integrate *Cosmos DB* data sources into enterprise analytical solutions that support modeling and reporting by data analysts.


## Azure Storage

<kbd>
    <img src="image7" height="auto" width="400" />
</kbd>

**Azure Storage** is a core Azure service that enables you to store data in:
* **Blob containers** - scalable, cost-effective storage for binary files.
* **File shares** - network file shares such as you typically find in corporate networks.
* **Tables** - key-value storage for applications that need to read and write data values quickly.

Data engineers use Azure Storage to host data lakes - blob storage with a hierarchical namespace that enables files to be organized in folders in a distributed file system.


## Azure Data Factory

<kbd>
    <img src="image8" height="auto" width="400" />
</kbd>

**Azure Data Factory** is an Azure service that enables you to *define* and *schedule* data pipelines to *transfer* and *transform* data. You can integrate your pipelines with other Azure services, enabling you to *ingest data* from cloud data stores, *process the data* using cloud-based compute, and *persist the results* in another data store.

**Azure Data Factory** is used by data engineers to build *extract*, *transform*, and *load* (ETL) solutions that populate analytical data stores with data from transactional systems across the organization.


## Azure Synapse Analytics

<kbd>

**Azure Synapse Analytics** is a comprehensive, unified *Platform-as-a-Service* (PaaS) solution for data analytics that provides a single service interface for multiple analytical capabilities, including:
* **Pipelines** - based on the same technology as `Azure Data Factory`.
* **SQL** - a highly scalable `SQL` database engine, optimized for data warehouse workloads.
* **Apache Spark** - an open-source distributed data processing system that supports multiple programming languages and `APIs`, including `Java`, `Scala`, `Python`, and `SQL`.
* **Azure Synapse Data Explorer** - a high-performance data analytics solution that is optimized for real-time querying of *log* and *telemetry* data using `Kusto Query` Language (KQL).

**Data engineers** can use Azure Synapse Analytics to create a unified data analytics solution that combines `data ingestion pipelines`, `data warehouse storage`, and `data lake storage` through a single service.

**Data analysts** can use `SQL` and `Spark` pools through interactive notebooks to explore and *analyze data*, and take advantage of integration with services such as `Azure Machine Learning` and `Microsoft Power BI` to create *data models* and *extract insights* from the data.


## Azure Databricks
